# Data Adapter sample for Espresso

An AdapterView (like ListView, GridView, etc.) is a view bound to an Adapter that determines the
view's children. In Espresso, you can match these children views using the onData() method instead of
onView() as you would do normally. Instead of matching views, onData() matches the data that is
bound to each view item.
