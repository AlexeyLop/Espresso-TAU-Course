This repo contains the course material for the Test Automation University Course `Introduction to Android Automation with Espresso` 

# Basic sample for Espresso Web

Espresso Web is an API that can be used to write automated tests for hybrid applications which
contain one or more WebViews. Similar to onData, WebView interactions are actually composed of
several ViewActions, however ViewActions in Espresso Web are composed of Web Driver Atoms.
Espresso Web takes care of synchronization and tries to minimize boilerplate to a bare minimum,
while still giving you an Espresso-like feel to interacting with WebViews.
